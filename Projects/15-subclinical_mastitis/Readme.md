## Neural network-aided milk somatic cell count gain prediction

Subclinical mastitis (SM) is the most economically damaging yet often visually undetectable disease of dairy cows. 
Early detection and treatment can reduce the loss caused by the disease, thus, the continuous improvement of SM diagnostic methods is necessary. 
Albeit, the somatic cell count (SCC) of milk is commonly measured for diagnostic purposes, its direct determination is not widely used in everyday practice.

The primary objective of the tasks is to investigate whether the predictive value of SM diagnostics can be improved with data generated using common milking machines.
