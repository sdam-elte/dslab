# Cell motion
### Consultant: David Visontai

In this project based on the work of Levine et al. and Zamir et al 
you will analyse 
motion of a human glioblastome cell culture.

### Introduction 

The dataset provided by the Czirok-Lab (ELTE) contains phase-contrast
microscopic time-lapse pictures of a cell culture. The pictures were taken
every 10 minutes. The picture names encode the experimental setting. (The files can be found at */home/public/Cell_motion/* directory in Kooplex in the Data science laboratory course container)
The first character of the name describes the cell-density
(A: 300 1/cm^2, B: 1000 1/cm^2, C:3000 1/cm^2, D: 10000 1/cm^2).
The second character (A,B,C) denotes the ring in the Petri-dish and
the number indicates the view within a ring (1,2,3,4).

### Tasks

#### 1. Data exploration 
Find individual cells with image segmentation. The usual method is a
sliding window approach, where the variance is tresholded for meaningful
results. See the reference of Levine et al above.

#### 2. Measure velocity of cells

Based on the work of Zamir et al (see above), find the time evolution of 
velocity of each identified cells and estimate the velocity distribution.

#### 3. Try to fit an anomalous diffusion model model to the measured data!
