# CMB power spectrum

### Introduction
The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation is one of the key source of information of modern cosmology. The goal of the project would be to understand CMB data and the tools used in the analysis and reconstruct the power spectrum generation from sky maps.

### Materials
- Hans Kristian Eriksen (Univ. Oslo) An introduction to the CMB power spectrum: http://folk.uio.no/hke/AST5220/v11/AST5220_2_2011.pdf - a local copy saved [here](AST5220_2_2011.pdf)

- Robert D. Klauber : A student friendly guide to the CMB:Â http://www.quantumfieldtheory.info/cmb_vers_2.pdf - a local copy saved [here](cmb_vers_2.pdf)
  - introductory material and walk-through 

- The McMahon Cosmology Lab ACT CMB School - with example analysis workflows: https://sites.google.com/uchicago.edu/themcmahoncosmologylab/cmb-summer-school
  - [notebook examples](https://github.com/jeffmcm1977/CMBAnalysis_SummerSchool) of data analysis
  - The [CAMB tool](https://camb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to generate spectra and maps with different cosmological parameters (used in [Part 8](https://github.com/jeffmcm1977/CMBAnalysis_SummerSchool/blob/master/CMB_School_Part_08.ipynb))
- Planck 2018 results: https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.06205 
- Plank 2018 CMB maps: https://pla.esac.esa.int/pla/

### Tasks
0. Read the introductory material and understand the basics of the CMB radiation.
1. Try to reproduce the CMB power spectrum using the Commander pipeline map of the Planck 2018 results. (You can check out other pipelines as well.)
2. Try generating your own CMB maps from the CAMB power spectra, using tools and methods you learned from the first task and the McMahon Cosmology Lab notebooks.
