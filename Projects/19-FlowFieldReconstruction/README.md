# Flow field reconstruction and tracer particle tracking in (rotating) flows

## Project summary:
Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) is a widely used, cross-correlation-based method for reconstructing quasi-2D velocity fields of fluid dynamics laboratory experiments from video recordings. For PIV, the working fluid (usually water) is seeded with small (10-100-micron-diameter) tracer particles, whose density closely matches that of the working fluid. The objective of this project is to identify and track as many individual tracer particles as reasonable achievable from video recordings as the ones to be shown in the briefing.

## Task
The task is to implement and test tracer-tracking algorithms in... whatever programming environment you prefer. 

This project is a direct preparation for a hydrodynamics experiment that is being developed at the von Karman Laboratory for Environmental Flows, and is to be performed on board the International Space Station in 2025 by the next Hungarian astronaut.
