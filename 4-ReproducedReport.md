## Presentation of the reproduced projects 

After the final presentations the projects will be shuffled and randomly redistributed. In the last two weeks (which is the round for the reproducibility test for each project) everyone has to  familiarize themselves with the new topic, use the material that was submitted by the original author, and try to reproduce the original results, maybe continue with new ideas and finally create a presentation. You will get all the files that will be submitted into the 'finalreport' directory. During this task you will evaluate and also your work will be evaluated as well.

The motivation for this is the real life situation when someone tries to continue another researcher's work. 
It happens often, that we finish a work and end up with many temporary and unnecessary files or folders. It is a good practice to clean up the mess and keep only those things that are really needed. It helps us also not lose track of the information and makes it easier for someone else to join the project and continue where we left off.
Nowadays it is also a requirement to supply data and auxiliary files with each publication to show that our findings are reproducible the way we described it in the article.

Your task is to **evaluate** how complicated or easy it is to use someone else's code. In order to do this you have to find out where she/he left off, what was needed for it and try to continue the project with simple new step if that is possible.

### What should these presentations cover?
* A brief reminder what the topic is about
* Summary of the findings of the project
* New results or the same results but presented with different visualisation techniques, from other aspects etc. if possible

### And questions that it should answer
* Was the work easy to reproduce? 
* Did you get similar plots that were presented to you?
* Was it obvious where to start?
- Was it straightforward to follow the project?
- Was everything included in the folder necessary for the project?

These presentations should be approximately **8 minutes** long.
