### Introduction 

Wikipedia is a large and growing knowledge database, where information is collected, 
reviewed an improved by several contributors from around the world. Some topics attract
different editors, who see the same object differently. In some cases this difference leads
to a peaceful discussion, which improves content, and results a high quality contribution
to the knowledge base. Though, in other cases, the controversal understanding by the editors
cumulates into a meaningsless fighting, which is called as wikipedia war. In this project
you are encuraged to explore the rich structure of the wikipedia, identify wars and draw
basic conclusions about the social or knowledge network of such problematic wikipedia pages.

### Tasks

#### 1. Data exploration 
Select an appropriate edition of wikipedia, which fits to your available computational resources.
Identify edit wars: a few sample articles, that triggered wars and a few editors, who participated in
edit wars.

#### 2. Explore social and knowledge network of idintified editors and pages
Most of the wikipedia pages are edited by several authors. When to authors are working on the same page,
or especially they are discussing somethink on a talk page, they are in a social relation with each other.
Draw the social network of fighting editors! 

If a wikipedia page links to another page, they are in a semantic relationship. Explore the semantic
network of pages, that triggered edit wars! Are they far from each other or do they build a dense group
in the semantic network of other pages?

#### 3. Dataset

Wikipedia dumps are awailable for download or online evaluation at the wikipedia archives.
