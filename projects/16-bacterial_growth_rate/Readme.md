## Bacterial colony size growth estimation by deep learning
The bacterial growth rate is important for pathogenicity and food safety. Therefore, the estimation of bacterial growth rate over time can provide important data from a medical and veterinary point of view. When bacteria are cultured on solid media, the growth rate is estimated from the change in bacterial colony size, which also allows differences in the growth characteristics of the colony-forming units to be studied. https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.25.538361v1.full
