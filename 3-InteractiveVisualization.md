## Interactive Visualization

 * Interactive HTML created from a notebook (ipywidgets, bokeh, holoviews, plotly, R shiny etc.)
 * An application hosted on Kooplex (bokeh, dash by plotly, R shiny etc.)
 * Or it could be anything else that can be shared and viewed within a web browser
 * The visualization should be related to the topic:
   * not necessarily about the results 
   * e.g. toy models for understanding concepts
